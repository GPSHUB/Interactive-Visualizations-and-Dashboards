# Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards
I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

In this project, I created a dashboard using HTML, JavaScript, D3 library (for advanced SVG rendering), Plotly, and a JSON data file.  The challenge was:
  To import the data
  Parse the parts needed for the charts,
  Organize the data with filters and sorts,
  Create the charts,
  Style the charts, 
  Populate the HTML divs with data,
  Create event handlers for changes when the drop-down filter is utilized.

The second challenge was to publish the work on GIT HUB Pages.

The work is deployed at the following location:
